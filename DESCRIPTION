Description: Fetches zonal statistics of weather indicators created for each Brazilian municipality. The dataset of zonal statistics was created using data from the 'BR-DWGD' project as source. For each municipality and weather indicator, a series of statistics was calculated considering the data cells that intersects the municipality.
    Other sources with weather indicators are planned to be included, as indicators for different soil cover and land use are also planned.
