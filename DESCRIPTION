Description: This package uses zonal weather indicators created for each Brazilian municipality with data from the BR-DWGD project (Xavier et al. 2022). For each municipality and weather indicator, a series of statistics was calculated considering the data cells that intersects the municipality.
    Other sources with weather indicators are planned to be included, as indicators for different soil coverages.
